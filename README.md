# Orzbob [![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/carnivoroustoad/orzbob)](https://github.com/carnivoroustoad/orzbob/releases/latest)

Orzbob is a terminal app that helps you become a 100x engineer by managing multiple [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code), [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) (and other local agents including [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider)) in separate workspaces, allowing you to work on multiple tasks simultaneously.

### Highlights
- Complete tasks in the background (including yolo / auto-accept mode!)
- Manage instances and tasks in one terminal window
- Review changes before applying them, checkout changes before pushing them
- Each task gets its own isolated git workspace, so no conflicts

```

Alternatively, you can also install `orzbob` by building from source or installing a [pre-built binary](https://github.com/carnivoroustoad/orzbob/releases).

<b>Using Orzbob with other AI assistants:</b>
- For [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex): Set your API key with `export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key>`
- Launch with specific assistants:
   - Codex: `orz -p "codex"`
   - Aider: `orz -p "aider ..."`
- Make this the default, by modifying the config file (locate with `orz debug`)

<br />

#### Menu
The menu at the bottom of the screen shows available commands: 

##### Instance/Session Management
- `n` - Create a new session
- `N` - Create a new session with a prompt
- `D` - Kill (delete) the selected session
- `â†‘/j`, `â†“/k` - Navigate between sessions

##### Actions
- `â†µ/o` - Attach to the selected session to reprompt
- `ctrl-q` - Detach from session
- `s` - Commit and push branch to github
- `c` - Checkout. Commits changes and pauses the session
- `r` - Resume a paused session
- `?` - Show help menu

##### Navigation
- `tab` - Switch between preview tab and diff tab
- `q` - Quit the application
- `shift-â†“/â†‘` - scroll in diff view

### How It Works

1. **tmux** to create isolated terminal sessions for each agent
2. **git worktrees** to isolate codebases so each session works on its own branch
3. A simple TUI interface for easy navigation and management
4. **Auto-updates** to keep your installation current with the latest features

### Configuration

You can customize Orzbob's behavior by editing the config file (find its location with `orz debug`). Some notable options:

- `default_program`: Set your preferred AI assistant as default
- `enable_auto_update`: Enable or disable checking for updates on startup
- `auto_install_updates`: Automatically install updates without prompting
